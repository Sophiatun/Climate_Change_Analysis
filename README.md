**An overview of the project and its purpose:**
Climate change is a critical global challenge for ecosystems, human societies, and overall health of our planet. Among the key indicators of climate change, shifts in temperature patterns have drawn significant attention due to their potential impact on  weather extremes and the overall stability of ecosystems. 

As weather analysts it’s our job to analyze rising global temperatures and assess the risk this might bring to citizens across the world. We’re gathering data from countries across the globe to determine which countries are most at risk. 

With this project we’re hoping to shed light on the impact climate change has on our planet and highlight the areas that are most at risk. 

**Questions we will answer:**
How have global temperature trends evolved throughout our date range?
How have temperature trends evolved throughout our date range in South Africa, India, Germany, United States, Brazil, Australia, and Antarctica?
Which states in South Africa, India, Germany, United States, Brazil, Australia, and Antarctica are experiencing the most rapid increase in temperature, and are there any regions experiencing a decrease?
Does a higher population result in higher temperatures? 
Does higher population result in more air pollution?
Do areas with more air pollution have higher temperatures?

We have two components to our website: Overview and Visualizations
In Overview you can find some background info and the purpose of our project.
In Visualizations you will see a dropdown that leads to our data visualizations that answer the questions outlined in our Overview. Click on one to be taken to the charts that address that specific topic. Under each chart we have added text with takeaways based on the analysis. 

**Ethical considerations made in the project:**
To ensure we avoided any issues with our data we made sure not to collect or work with any data that would invade privacy. We only shared proper info and data from reliable sources and ensured we were not working with any kind of leaked data. We made sure we included uncertainty - ethical consideration (allows the audience to understand the reliability of the information they’re getting) - but we took out the uncertainty cols. We also included one country from every continent (except Alaska) to ensure we were looking at the project from a global perspective.
